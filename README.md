### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜„

## About

I'm Scott Ouellette, a **DevOps Engineer** at [Indigo Agriculture](https://www.indigoag.com/).

I currently work on the **Build & Deploy Team** where we own and maintain common tooling, infrastructure, and practices around building and deploying software, shared between engineering teams at Indigo.

## Side Projects

Recently I've been kicking the tires on: https://github.com/scottx611x/hcl-playground to:
* Get up to speed with the world of Kubernetes
* Solve some terraform protoyping toil that I've run into relating to the `terraform console` workflow
